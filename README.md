# optimi_heart_project
End of the Course Project for Applied Stats and Convex Optimization Course: 
Used Latex and R.
In this project, I go over Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent.
I use logistical regression on heart disease dataset and then gradient descent to optimize.
I compare results with logistical regression method in base R.

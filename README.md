# optimi_heart_project
In this project, I explore heart disease risk with UCI's heart disease dataset.
I go over Logistic Regression and Gradient Descent.
I built logistical regression model with dataset and then gradient descent to optimize.
I compare results with logistical regression method in base R.

Built, visualized, and tested in R markdown. Also used some R packages for visualizations.

Check out the Model#.Rmd s for how I made the models, how it was tested/evaluated.

Check out other .Rmd s for building the visualizations (ROC graphs, etc.)
